As college students, who use Zoom for class on a daily basis, we have encountered many issues with this platform. A few are: not being able to mute chat, having a hard time keeping track of zoom links, and only being able to private message one person at a time. To fix these issues, we created a new, better than Zoom website that not only will host all of the features we desire, but even more that Zoom does not have at all. For example, we have also included a password generator, word counter, and formatting convention for copy and pasting text with whitespace.
